- Beta-adrenergic agonists cause hypokalemia: due to increased activity of Na-K-ATPase pump => transport potassium intracellularly
- Hypokalemia due to intracellular translocation: Insulin, beta adrenergic, alkalosis, increased cell reproduction (leukemia)
- First ion channels to be activated immediately following hyperpolarization: HCN-channels (aloow the passage of both Na and K ion => cell repolarize membrane => T type Ca open
- Potassium channel open at rest and close when depolarization: Inward rectifier IK1 potassium channels
- Hyperkalemia: Can be treated with beta agonist due to beta agonist => Increase renin => Increase aldosterol => Increase Kali excretion; it also can increase potassium entry the cells. Beta antagonist can worsen the hyperkalemia and inhibit renin release by the kidney to decrease blood pressure
- Hyperkalemia after using glycosides: Digitalis toxicity => Use digoxin immune Fab. Digoxin toxicity can change in color vision (yellow tinting of objects), cardiac arrhythmias. Digoxin is renally cleared, and the dose must be reduced in elderly patients, even with normal creatinine.
- Plataeu phase of action potential in cardiac myocytes: L-type Calcium channel
- Hypocalcemia or acute hyperkalemia => Increased neuronal excitability: Increased resting membrane potential, decreased firing threshold for the action potential, and decreased afterhyperpolarization. Resting membrane potential caused by high potassium conductance and some sodium conductance
- Calcium channel blocker mechanism: Binds to L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockers => prevent Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space into the intracellular space => Affect mostly the smooth muscles and cardiac muscles (because voltage-gated calcium channels link to the ryanodine receptor expressed on the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane => do not need a calcium influx to stimulate contraction). Side effects include peripheral edema, constipation, gingival hyperplasia
- Calcium channel blocker does not have effect on skeletal muscle: Because skeletal muscle is not dependent on extraceullular calcium influx
- Ion channel: Ungated ion channels always open, gated ion channels include ligand-gated (nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, GABAA receptors, glycine, and AMPA receptors) and voltage-gated ion channels. NMDA is both ligand-gated (glycine) and voltage-gated (Mg2+) ion channel.

Heart and vessels
- Increase atrioventricular nodal conduction delay: Adenosine binds to A1 receptor and increase potassium conduction and inhibit calcium channel => prolong depolarization time. Side effects: flushing, chest burning, hypotension, shortness of breath. Acetylcholine increase potassium conduction, while decreasing calcium and sodium inward
- Atrial fibrillation: Atrioventricular node refractory period determines the ventricle rate. The jugular venous tracing shows abnormal waves, indicating abnormal atrial contraction. Caused by atrial remodeling, or ectopic electrical foci in the pulmonary veins
- The sinoatrial node locates at the junction of right atrium and superior vena cava. The atrioventricular node is located on the endocardial surface of the right atrium, near the insertion of the opening of the coronary sinus
- Atrial flutter: Caused by large reentrant circuit at right atrial tissue between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve annulus
- Rate control in heart failure and atrial fibrillation: beta blockers and digitalis. Calcium channel blockers are contraindicated in heart failure

- Normal right atrial pressure (RAP): 7 mmHg
- Stable angina (caused by atherosclerotic lesion that obstructs >70% of the lumen): Nitroglycerin => Venodilation => Decrease venous return to the heart and preload.

- Vasodilator relate to the coagulation: Factor XII => Kallikrein activation => convert kininogen to bradykinin
- Heart sound S3: Rapid  filling of the ventricle, normal in the person with thick ventricle or pregnancy
- Heart sound: S3: systolic dysfunction can caused by large volume of blood from left atrium to left ventricle. S4: diastolic dysfunction can caused by stiff ventricular wall such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, can obstruct left ventricle outflow and cause a murmur => the murmur decrease when increase preload or afterload
- Amiodarone and digoxin: Amiodarone,, verapamil or clarithromycin increase digoxin blood levels by inhibition of the P-glycoprotein => Increase digoxin absorption in intestine and decrease digoxin excretion in liver. Amiodarone can cause hypothyroidism due to have iodine => test serum TSH before treatment.
- Rate control in atrial fibrillation: by slowing conduction through the atrioventricular node => beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (both effective during rest and exercise), and digoxin (via increased parasympathetic tone, poorly controls ventricular rate during exercise)

- Systolic heart failure in African American: Isosorbide dinitrate (venodilator) + hydralazine (arterial dilator). Dinitrate can dilate the intracerebral arterioles => tension headache (low-intensity, band-like)
- Anti-arrhythmic drugs: Class III (potassium channel blocker, lol, lide) can prolong QT interval, and sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide can also prolong PR interval due to have beta blocking effect. Class I (such as flecainide) has use dependence => improved binding to the Na+ channels in active states and more efficacy at higher heart rate. For class I, sodium-channel-binding strength is IC (nide, none) > IA (amide) > IB (ine)

- Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia treatment: Adenosine after unsuccessful vagal maneuvers=> slowing AV node conductance and interrupting the re-entry pathways
- Torsades de points: Caused by prolongs repolarization state (QT) => Class III antiarrhythmic (block K+) such as sotalol can cause the issue. Amiodarone has very little risk.
 
- Ventricular tachycardia: adrenaline 1 mg IV + amiodarone 300 mg IV after the second shock. If amiodarone cannot be used => lidocaine 1 mg/kg IV can be used. Class IA (quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide): block fast acting Na channel, slowing the phase 0 upswing, and block K+ channels => increasing the action potential duration and QT interval; used for both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, but prolong QT so can cause torsades de points. Class IB (lidocaine, mexiletine): increase refractory, enhance K+ efflux => shortening the AP potential,  used only for ventricular arrhythmias, and used in ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias. Class IC (flecainide, propafenone): strong Na+ channel blockade but not effect on K+ channel => No effect on AP duration or QT interval. used only for atrial arrhythmias.

- Phenylephrine (a1 agonist): Increase IP3 in vascular smooth muscle cells => increase blood pressure => Reflex to decrease cyclic AMP activity in the heart => Decrease heart rate and myocardial contractility, decrease inward calcium current in sinoatrial cells
- Thromboembolism after using heparin: Due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, due to anti platelet factor 4 and heparin antibody production. Treat with direct thrombin inhibitor such as argatroban
- Pain and swelling in the leg, pitting edema: deep venous thrombosis => Treat with heparin + oral anticoagulant (warfarin, direct factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban, rivaroxaban), direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran)). Direct factor Xa inhibitor can prolong PT and aPTT but no effect on thrombin time due to decreased conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Factor Xa inhibitor and heparin binds to antithrombin III to stop Xa from converting prothrombin to thrombin.
- Drug that can cause a redistribution of blood flow away from the ischemic areas, exacerbating existing myocardial ischemia (cornonary steal): coronary arteriolar dilation (such as adenosine, dipyridamole, nitric oxide). Selective arteriolar vasodilator (hydralazine, minoxidil): lower blood pressure by reducing systemic vascular resistance => reflex sympathetic activation: increase heart rate, contractility, cardiac output, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis => sodium and fluid retention with peripheral edema.
- Differential cyanosis (cyanosis affecting only the lower body): right to left shunting across the ductus arteriosus. Due to the persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn

- Cardiac murmur
 

- Holosystolic murmur: tricuspid regurgitation (increase with inspiration), mitral regurgitation (no change with inspiration), and ventricular septal defect
- Coronary dominance: determined by coronary artery supplying the posterior descending artery: right dominant = right coronary artery, left dominant = left circumflex artery. The domiant coronary artery also supply blood to the atrioventricular node
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm risk: male > 65, smoking
- Headache, jaw claudication: giant cell (temporal) arteritis => granulomatous inflammation of the media with fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina => Can cause ischemic optic neuropathy due to ophthalmic artery occlusion => Treat glucocorticoid immediately
 
- Stenotic and tortuous artery, tissue ischemia and aneurysm formation, absent internal elastic lamina: fibromuscular dysplasia => cause renal artery stenosis
- Cardiac action potential conduction speed: Purkinje system > atrial muscle > ventricular muscle > AV node
- Stress-induced cardiomyopathy: hypokinesis of the mid and apical segments, and hyperkinesis of the basal segment of the left ventricle => systolic dysfunction, this is due to the surge of catecholamine in the setting of the stress, resolves within several weeks.

Central, cigarettes, keratin pearls => Squamous cells. Peripheral, glandular pattern => adenocarcinoma. Peripheral, pleomorphic giant cells => Large cell carcinoma. Squamouse cell carcinoma can cause a paraneoplastic syndrome of hypercalcemia due to secretion of parathyroid hormon-related peptide (P = squamous). Small cell carcinoma causes large hilar mass with mediastinal adenopathy

- Impaired intestinal blood flow: Anaerobic environment => elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio => Decrease activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (convert to acetyl-CoA) and increase activity of lactate dehydrogenase (convert pyruvate to lactate) => Lactic acidosis. In patients with deficient lactate dehydrogenase => low level of NAD+, NAD+ is required to convert glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-biphosphoglycerate in glycolysis. In case of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency => Treat with ketogenic diet: high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet with moderate levels of protein. Lysine and leucin (2L) can be use because they cannot metabolized to pyruvate

- Excess saliva, air in stomach: Esophageal atresia with distal transesophageal fistula
- Left lower abdomen tenderness, fever, increased leukocyte count: Diverticulitis through attenuated muscularis propria that can cause bleeding due to disruption of vasa recta => Colonoscopy
- Gallstone after fibrate treatment: Fibrate increase oxidation of fatty acid but inhibit cholesterol 7a hydroxylase => decrease bile acid => Decrease solubility of cholesterol in bile and form cholesterol stone. Cholesterol stone is formed by increased cholesterol, and decrease bile acid and phosphatidylcholine. Can be treated with bile acids (ursodeoxycholic). Aromatase, b glucuronidase, HMG CoA reductase, and thiolase increase cholesterol synthesis => Increase bile stone. Cholesterol stone thinks 7a hydroxylase.

Other symptoms includes heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, nocturnal cough, hoarseness. Pregnant women and obesity often develop GERD due to elevated estrogen and progesterol => Relax smooth muscle of the lower esophageal sphincter
- Management of variceal hemorrhage: Somatostatin and octreotide inhibit the release of endogenous hormons that induce splanchnic vasodilation => Reducing portal blood flow
- Abdominal pain, blood diarrhea, fever, signs of shock: Toxic megacolon caused by ulcerative colitits. Ulcerative colitis is treated with mesalamine to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins and inflammatory cytokines or sulfasalazine (broken down into 5-ASA and sulfapyridine, inhibiting leukotriene synthesis and lipoxygenase).

Most patients experience tubular re-epithelization and regain normal renal function.
- Earliest change to occur within the renal tubules during the ischemic period: Loss of epithelial cell polarity. Depletion of ATP causes rapid cytoskeletal disruption => loss of cell adhesion and cause redistribution of integrins, and Na-K-ATPase from the basolateral membrane to the apical membrane
- Absorption of sodium in kidney: Proximal tubule is responsible for reabsorbing most of the filtered sodium in all conditions
- Regulation of potassium in the kidney: Occur mostly in the cortical collecting tubules => Due to activity of Na+-K+ pump of principle cells (control by aldosterone).
